homebrew-formulas
=================

A (small) collection of homebrew formulas for mac os x. (For the moment, just haxe 3 and neko 2.0.0.)

## Installation

Using brew's tap command will make all formulas available:

    brew tap nbrew/homebrew-formulas

Another quick way (though not recommended due to namespace issues) to grab just one Formula using curl:
    
    cd /usr/local/Library/Formula
    curl -O 'https://raw.github.com/nbrew/homebrew-formulas/master/Formula/haxe.rb'
