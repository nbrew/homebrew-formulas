homebrew-formulas
=================

A (small) collection of homebrew formulas. (For the moment, just haxe 3 and neko 2.0.0.)

Install formulas by copying into /usr/local/Library/Formula (or run the really simple install.sh which does the same.)

Another quick way to grab just one Formula using curl:
    
    cd /usr/local/Library/Formula
    curl -O 'https://raw.github.com/nbrew/homebrew-formulas/master/Formula/haxe.rb'
